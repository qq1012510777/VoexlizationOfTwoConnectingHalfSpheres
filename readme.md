# Description
The script 'voxelization_sphere.m' performs the voxelization of a sand model, and the model consists of two half spheres.

If the intersection volume between the sphere and a cube, or say, voxel, exceeds 50% of the cube, then the cube belong to the sphere.

The script 'Voxelization_SandWater.m' performs the voxelization of sand and water, and the sand consists of two half spheres.

The (absorbed) water is held in a film on the surface of two half spheres, i.e., the connection of two sand spheres.

The script 'Voxelization_SandWater.m' allows offset voxelization along z axis!
